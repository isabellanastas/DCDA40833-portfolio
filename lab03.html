            <h2>Critique</h2>
            
            <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
            <p>The Beautiful News infographic, “Fewer Pregnant Women Are Dying - 42% Fewer Maternal Deaths” communicates a clear and encouraging message, but it does so with limited depth. The visualization is effective at quickly presenting an impactful statistic that is easy for viewers to understand and remember. However, in terms of completeness, the graphic has relatively low background information. It does not include a timeline or numerical context beyond the headline percentage. Key details such as the years being compared, the original number of maternal deaths, or how the reduction varies are missing. Tufte emphasizes that strong visualizations should present data in a way that allows viewers to see patterns, differences, and context. In this case, the simplicity of the design prioritizes clarity and positivity, but it limits the viewer’s ability to fully interpret the data. While the audience learns that maternal deaths have declined, they are not given enough information to understand where or how this progress has occurred, which reduces the overall informational value of the visualization.</p>

            <h3>Effects without Causes</h3>
            <p>Another major concern with the infographic is that it presents effects without causes. The graphic clearly states that maternal deaths have decreased by 42 percent, but it does not explain what factors contributed to this improvement. There is no mention of advancements in medical care, increased access to prenatal care, skilled healthcare workers, or public health initiatives that have played a role in reducing maternal mortality. Without this context, the statistic feels detached from the efforts behind it. This weakens the power of the visualization because viewers are shown the outcome but not the reasons behind it. By focusing only on the end result, the infographic misses an opportunity to help viewers understand what actually drives positive change and how similar progress could be used.</p>

            <h3>Cherry Picking</h3>
            <p>The infographic also raises concerns related to cherry-picking. By highlighting one positive global statistic, the visualization presents a simplified narrative that emphasizes progress while excluding important contextual information. Although maternal mortality has declined overall, this progress has not been equal across populations. Many low-income countries continue to experience high rates of maternal death, but these are not acknowledged in the graphic. By only presenting the favorable number, the visualization encourages a broadly optimistic interpretation that may overlook ongoing challenges. This selective framing does not make the data incorrect, but it does make the story incomplete. Cherry-picking in this case limits the viewer’s ability to critically assess the full scope of maternal health outcomes and understand where improvement is still urgently needed.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Overall, the infographic is effective as a visually engaging and uplifting piece of communication, but it falls short of Edward Tufte’s standards for high-resolution data visualization. The design is clean and accessible, making the message easy to grasp, but the lack of contextual detail, and causal explanation reduces its analytical strength. The visualization successfully communicates that progress has been made, but it does not provide enough information for viewers to fully understand that progress. Adding elements such as timelines, additional regions, or brief explanations of contributing factors would strengthen the visualization’s integrity and bring it more in line with Tufte’s principles.</p>
