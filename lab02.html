            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>For this exploration, I focused on using AI as a tool to support my job application and career development process. I used it primarily for tasks such as drafting and refining cover letters, preparing for interviews, tailoring resumes to job descriptions, and polishing professional networking messages. I chose to explore AI in this way because I am graduating in three months and actively navigating the job search, making these tasks especially relevant and timely at this stage of my life.</p>

            <h2>Tool 1: ChatGPT</h2>
            <h3>Capabilities</h3>
            <p>Based on my exploration, ChatGPT was most effective as a support tool during my job search process. I primarily used it to help brainstorm and refine cover letters, tailor resumes to specific job descriptions, prepare for interview questions, and polish networking messages for LinkedIn or email. For example, I would paste in a job description and my resume and ask ChatGPT to help identify key skills to emphasize or suggest stronger phrasing that aligned with the role. This helped me articulate my experiences more clearly and professionally, especially when I knew what I wanted to say but struggled with wording.</p> 

<p>ChatGPT fell short when prompts were vague or when the content required deeply personal judgment or storytelling. If I relied too heavily on its first draft, the writing sometimes sounded generic or overly formal. I often had to revise outputs to ensure my voice, specific experiences, and authenticity were preserved. It also occasionally made assumptions about roles or responsibilities that I had to correct, reinforcing the need for human review.</p>

            <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
            <p>A strong use case for ChatGPT is as a drafting, editing, and brainstorming assistant in the job application process. It works best when I already have content or direction and use the tool to refine structure, clarity, or tone. For example, it was especially helpful for tailoring cover letters to different companies, practicing behavioral interview questions, and tightening LinkedIn messages to meet character limits.</p>
            <p>A poor use case would be using ChatGPT to fully generate application materials without personal input or reflection. Submitting AI-generated content without editing or understanding it would undermine authenticity and could misrepresent my skills or experiences. It would also be inappropriate to use the tool to answer interview questions in real time or to mislead employers about my abilities.</p>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <p>Using ChatGPT raises concerns related to authorship, originality, and academic or professional integrity. Because the tool can generate polished language quickly, there is a risk of over-reliance or presenting AI-assisted work as entirely self-produced. In my use, I addressed this by treating ChatGPT as a support tool rather than a replacement for my own thinking, ensuring that all final materials reflected my real experiences and judgment. </p>
            <p>From the developer’s side, ChatGPT includes usage guidelines and safeguards that discourage misuse, such as presenting generated content as factual without verification or engaging in dishonest behavior. However, the responsibility ultimately lies with the user. Ethical use requires transparency, critical evaluation of outputs, and intentional editing to maintain authenticity and honesty throughout the job search process.
