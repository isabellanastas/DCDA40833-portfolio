            <p>Welcome to my Skills Portfolio for DCDA 40833. This site highlights the work I completed throughout the semester and reflects my growth in digital culture and data analytics. As a Strategic Communication major, this portfolio represents how I’ve learned to analyze cultural patterns and translate insights into meaningful digital projects.</p>
            <p>Each page features a different lab assignment, showing my progression from foundational web development skills to more advanced data visualization and interactive mapping. Together, these projects demonstrate not only my technical development, but also how I approach storytelling, analysis, and design through a digital lens.</p>

I started experimenting with the foundational tools we will be using throughout the semester. </p>
            <p><strong>Challenges I overcame:</strong> Adjusting to new technical tools was challenging at first, but working through trial and error helped me build confidence. </p>
            <p><strong>How I grew:</strong> [How did your understanding of digital culture and data analytics evolve?]</p>
            <p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> [How will you apply these skills in the future?]</p>
